<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! My name is Chrystal Alanis. I am 40 years old and i am a nurse who is
  trying to learn full stack web development.
</p>

<p>
  I became a nurse in 2017 and i still am currently practicing as a nurse. I
  work for a pediatric home health company.
</p>

<p>
  Computers have always fascinated me and i have recently taking a liking to web
  development. I bought a course from Udemy and have been working on a full
  stack web development program in hopes to put this to use and land a job or do
  side gigs.
